# üë• Team Collaboration Workflow

Learn how to use APEX Enhanced effectively in team environments, from pair programming to large distributed teams.

## Team Collaboration Principles

APEX Enhanced adapts to different team structures:
- **Pair Programming**: Real-time collaboration with AI
- **Code Reviews**: Sandi Metz-style constructive feedback
- **Team Standards**: Shared configuration and patterns
- **Knowledge Sharing**: AI learns from team patterns

## Collaboration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pair Programming with AI

When two developers work together using APEX:

```
Dev 1: "Let's implement the user search feature together"

Dev 2: "I'll drive first. APEX, help us implement user search"

AI: "I'll guide you both through this. Since you're pairing, I'll:
- Explain my reasoning for both of you
- Suggest when to switch drivers
- Point out different approaches you might discuss

Starting with clarifying questions for the pair..."
```

#### Pair Programming Best Practices

```typescript
// AI suggests discussion points
AI: "Before we implement, let's discuss:
1. Should we use full-text search or simple matching?
2. Real-time or on-submit search?

What do you both think?"

// Driver (Dev 1) types while Navigator (Dev 2) reviews
// AI assists both roles

// For Driver
AI: "Here's the test structure. Dev 2, does this cover 
    the cases you're thinking about?"

// For Navigator  
AI: "Dev 2, I notice a potential edge case with special 
    characters. Want to discuss with Dev 1?"
```

### Scenario 2: Asynchronous Collaboration

When team members work in different time zones:

```markdown
## Morning (Dev in Tokyo)

Dev 1: "Starting the payment feature. APEX, let's plan this out."

AI: "I'll document everything clearly for your team:

### Payment Feature Plan
- Started by: @dev1 (Tokyo)
- Time: 2024-01-15 09:00 JST
- Status: Planning phase

[Detailed plan...]

I'll create detailed notes for the team member who continues this."

## Afternoon (Dev in London)

Dev 2: "I'll continue the payment feature. APEX, catch me up."

AI: "Here's what Dev 1 accomplished:
- ‚úÖ Created payment service structure
- ‚úÖ Added Stripe configuration
- üîÑ Partially implemented webhook handler
- ‚è≥ Tests need completion

Current blockers:
- Need decision on refund policy
- Webhook URL needs DevOps setup

Shall I show you the code context?"
```

### Scenario 3: Code Review Enhancement

APEX enhances team code reviews:

```typescript
// Developer submits PR
Dev: "APEX, prepare this PR for team review"

AI: "I'll add context for reviewers:

## PR Context for Reviewers

### What This Changes
- Adds real-time search to user dashboard
- Implements debouncing for performance
- Uses existing SearchService pattern

### Key Decisions
1. **Debounce delay**: 300ms (based on UX research)
2. **Result limit**: 20 items (matches pagination)
3. **Cache strategy**: 5-minute TTL

### Areas Needing Review
- üîç Performance: Check the query optimization
- üîç UX: Verify search feels responsive
- üîç Edge cases: Empty results handling

### Testing Notes
- Unit tests: 95% coverage
- E2E test added for search flow
- Manually tested with 10k records

@team-lead: Security review needed for SQL injection prevention
@ux-team: Please verify loading states
"
```

## Team Configuration

### Shared APEX Configuration

Create team-wide settings in `.apex-team.yml`:

```yaml
# Team standards enforced by APEX
team:
  name: "Platform Team"
  standards:
    code_review_required: true
    min_reviewers: 2
    test_coverage: 85
    
  patterns:
    - "Use dependency injection for services"
    - "Prefer composition over inheritance"
    - "All API endpoints need integration tests"
    
  conventions:
    naming:
      files: kebab-case
      components: PascalCase
      functions: camelCase
      constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    
    imports:
      order: ["react", "external", "internal", "relative"]
      groups: true
      aliases:
        "@": "src/"
        "@components": "src/components"
        
  code_owners:
    "src/payments/": ["@payments-team"]
    "src/auth/": ["@security-team"]
    "*.sql": ["@database-team"]
```

### Team Knowledge Base

APEX learns from your team:

```markdown
## Team Patterns (Learned by APEX)

### Authentication Pattern
- Always use AuthService.validateUser()
- Never store passwords in logs
- Session timeout: 30 minutes
- Learned from: PR #234 by @senior-dev

### Error Handling Pattern
- Use Result<T, E> pattern for operations that can fail
- Never throw in async functions
- Always log errors with context
- Learned from: Team retrospective 2024-01

### Testing Pattern
- Use builders for test data
- Group tests by user journey
- Always test error paths
- Learned from: Multiple PRs
```

## Collaborative Features

### 1. Smart Work Distribution

```
Team Lead: "APEX, we need to implement a reporting dashboard. 
           How should we split this among 3 developers?"

AI: "Based on the requirements and your team's expertise:

### Suggested Work Distribution

**Developer 1 (@frontend-expert)**
- Report UI components
- Data visualization (charts)
- Export functionality
- Estimated: 2 days

**Developer 2 (@backend-expert)**
- Report generation service
- Data aggregation queries  
- Caching layer
- Estimated: 2 days

**Developer 3 (@fullstack)**
- API endpoints
- Integration between frontend/backend
- Real-time updates
- Estimated: 2 days

### Integration Points
Day 1: Define interfaces together
Day 2-3: Parallel development
Day 4: Integration and testing

Would you like me to create tasks for each developer?"
```

### 2. Conflict Prevention

```typescript
// APEX warns about potential conflicts

Dev 1: "I'll refactor the UserService"

AI: "‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up: I see that @dev2 is currently working on 
    the authentication flow (PR #456) which heavily uses 
    UserService.
    
    Suggestions:
    1. Coordinate with @dev2 first
    2. Consider waiting for PR #456 to merge
    3. Or create a shared branch for both changes
    
    What would you prefer?"
```

### 3. Knowledge Transfer

```
New Dev: "I'm new to the team. Help me understand the payment system."

AI: "Welcome! Let me give you a comprehensive overview:

### Payment System Overview

**Architecture** (from team docs)
- Service: PaymentService handles all payment logic
- Pattern: We use the Strategy pattern for providers
- Testing: Always use Stripe test mode locally

**Team Conventions** (learned from PRs)
- Always log payment attempts (no sensitive data)
- Use idempotency keys for all operations
- Test with these specific cards: [list]

**Recent Changes** (from git history)
- @dev1 added refund functionality (PR #234)
- @dev2 improved error handling (PR #245)
- @dev3 added webhook processing (PR #256)

**Key Files to Review**
1. `src/services/PaymentService.ts` - Core logic
2. `src/api/payments.ts` - API endpoints
3. `tests/payments.test.ts` - See test patterns

**Team Contacts**
- Payment expert: @senior-dev
- Architecture decisions: @tech-lead
- Business logic: @product-owner

Would you like me to walk through a specific part?"
```

### 4. Standup Assistance

```
Team Lead: "APEX, give us a team status update"

AI: "### Team Status - January 15, 2024

**In Progress**
- @dev1: User search feature (75% complete)
  - ‚úÖ Backend API done
  - üîÑ Frontend integration

**Team Velocity**
- This sprint: 45/60 points completed
- On track for sprint goals"
```

## Code Review Culture

### APEX-Enhanced Reviews

```typescript
// Reviewer comments on PR
Reviewer: "APEX, review this payment code"

AI: "### APEX Code Review

**üåü Excellent Work**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage (94%)
- Good error handling

**ü§î Consider These Improvements**

1. **Opportunity for Clarity** (lines 45-52)
   The payment validation logic could be more explicit:
   ```typescript
   // Current
   if (!isValid(payment)) throw new Error('Invalid');
   
   // Suggested
   const validation = validatePayment(payment);
   if (!validation.isValid) {
     throw new PaymentValidationError(validation.errors);
   }
   ```

2. **Future-Proofing Question**
   "What happens when we add cryptocurrency payments?"
   Current design handles it well, but consider extracting
   an interface for payment providers.

3. **Performance Note**
   The transaction includes 3 DB queries. Could batch into 1?
   Not critical, but worth considering for scale.

**‚úÖ Security Check**
- Input validation ‚úì
- SQL injection prevention ‚úì
- Rate limiting ‚úì

Overall: Great implementation! The suggestions are 
enhancements to already good code."
```

### Review Automation

```yaml
# .github/apex-review.yml
review_automation:
  auto_checks:
    - test_coverage
    - code_complexity
    - security_scan
    - performance_impact
    
  require_review_from:
    "src/payments/": ["payments-team"]
    "src/security/": ["security-team"]
    "*.sql": ["database-team"]
    
  auto_approve_if:
    - coverage > 90
    - complexity < 5
    - no_security_issues
    - approved_by_code_owner
```

## Team Learning

### APEX Learns from Your Team

```
After Sprint Retrospective:

Team: "APEX, we decided to change our error handling pattern"

AI: "I'll update my knowledge:

### Updated Error Handling Pattern
OLD: Throwing exceptions
NEW: Result<T, E> pattern

I'll now suggest this pattern in future implementations
and flag old patterns in code reviews.

Should I create a migration guide for existing code?"
```

### Pattern Recognition

```typescript
// APEX notices patterns
AI: "I've observed your team frequently implements this pattern:

```typescript
// Repository pattern with caching
class UserRepository {
  constructor(
    private db: Database,
    private cache: Cache
  ) {}
  
  async findById(id: string): Promise<User | null> {
    const cached = await this.cache.get(`user:${id}`);
    if (cached) return cached;
    
    const user = await this.db.users.findById(id);
    if (user) {
      await this.cache.set(`user:${id}`, user, TTL);
    }
    return user;
  }
}
```

Should I add this to team patterns and suggest it for new repositories?"
```

## Distributed Team Tools

### Time Zone Awareness

```
Dev (PST): "I'm implementing the critical auth fix"

AI: "I'll make sure the team knows:
- Creating detailed PR description for async review
- Adding extra documentation for team members in EU/Asia
- Scheduling merge for when @security-reviewer (GMT) is online
- Setting up pair session invite for @dev2 (JST) tomorrow"
```

### Handoff Documentation

```markdown
## Handoff: User Search Feature

**From**: @dev1 (signing off at 6 PM PST)
**To**: @dev2 (starting at 9 AM GMT)

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Search API endpoint complete
- ‚úÖ Basic frontend integration
- üîÑ Debouncing implemented (needs testing)
- ‚ùå Error states not handled

### Next Steps
1. Test debouncing with slow network
2. Add error state handling
3. Implement empty state design
4. Add analytics tracking

### Context You Need
- Search uses Elasticsearch
- Debounce delay: 300ms (product decision)
- Max results: 20 (performance limit)

### Known Issues
- Special characters not escaped yet
- Need to handle rate limiting

### Questions for Team
- Should we cache search results?
- How to handle offline mode?

Good luck! Ping me on Slack if you need anything.
```

## Collaboration Anti-Patterns

### What to Avoid

```
‚ùå Don't: Work in isolation
Dev: "I'll refactor everything without telling anyone"

‚úÖ Do: Communicate changes
Dev: "APEX, help me plan this refactor and notify the team"
```

```
‚ùå Don't: Override team standards
Dev: "I prefer different formatting"

‚úÖ Do: Follow team configuration
Dev: "APEX, ensure this follows our team standards"
```

```
‚ùå Don't: Skip documentation
Dev: "The code is self-explanatory"

‚úÖ Do: Document for your team
Dev: "APEX, add context for team members who'll maintain this"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Morning Sync

```
Dev: "APEX, what should I know this morning?"

AI: "Good morning! Here's your digest:
- PR #234 was merged (auth changes)
- @dev2 needs review on payments PR
- Build failed on main (investigating)
- @tech-lead scheduled architecture review at 2 PM
- You have 3 PRs awaiting your review"
```

### 2. Clear Communication

```typescript
// APEX helps write clear commit messages for team
git commit -m "feat(search): add user search with debouncing

- Implement real-time search on user dashboard
- Add 300ms debounce to prevent API spam  
- Use existing SearchService for consistency
- Cache results for 5 minutes

Pairs with: @frontend-dev
Reviewed by: @tech-lead
Part of: JIRA-123"
```

### 3. Knowledge Persistence

```
Team Lead: "APEX, document our sprint decisions"

AI: "I'll create a decision record:

## Sprint 15 Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Adopt Result Pattern
- **Context**: Too many try-catch blocks
- **Decision**: Use Result<T, E> for fallible operations
- **Participants**: Entire team
- **Date**: 2024-01-15

### Decision 2: Increase Test Coverage Target
- **Context**: Recent bugs in production
- **Decision**: Raise minimum from 80% to 85%
- **Participants**: @tech-lead, @qa-lead
- **Date**: 2024-01-16

I'll reference these in future code reviews."
```

## Remote Team Features

### Virtual Pair Programming

```
Dev 1: "APEX, facilitate our remote pairing session"

AI: "I'll help coordinate your pairing:

### Pairing Session: Auth Refactor
**Participants**: @dev1 (driver), @dev2 (navigator)
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Goal**: Refactor authentication to use new pattern

**Rotation Reminder**: Switch roles every 25 minutes

I'll:
- Keep track of decisions made
- Suggest when to take breaks
- Document key insights
- Remind about role switches
- Create summary at the end"
```

### Async Code Reviews

```
Reviewer: "APEX, I need to review this later. Set it up for async review."

AI: "I'll prepare an async review format:

### Async Review Checklist

**For Reviewer** (@reviewer)
- [ ] Security implications checked
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
